You are strongly encouraged to create a video of the game play to help players understand how to play the game. Use a smart phone to record the action and post it to an online video sharing service such as YouTube or Vimeo. Link to the video using the videos sharing URL. Do not upload the video to GitHub since it will undoubtedly be too large.
